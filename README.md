1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction.
2. Try to eat the apples to grow and earn points.
3. Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body.

### Features

- Score tracking: I created a score to monitor the score. As the score increases, the speed increases proportionally. 
- Increasing difficulty: As the snake grows longer and moves faster, the game becomes more challenging.
- Random apple generation: The apple is generated randomly, taking care never to generate it in fields occupied by the snake's divs.
