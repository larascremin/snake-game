### 🐍 SNAKE GAME 

This is a simple Snake Game developed in JavaScript. <br>
All design and illustrations, including pixel art, were also made by me.

### Features

- I created a score tracking to monitor the score and display the score and when the game goes over.
- As the score increases, the speed increases proportionally and the snake moves faster.
- The apple is generated randomly, taking care never to generate it in fields occupied by the snake's divs.
