### SNAKE GAME 🐍 

This is a simple Snake Game developed in JavaScript. <br>
All design and illustrations, including pixel art, were also made by me.

### Features

I created a score tracking to monitor the score and display the score. As the score increases, <br> 
the speed increases proportionally and the snake moves faster. The apple is generated randomly, <br> 
taking care never to generate it in fields occupied by the snake's divs.
