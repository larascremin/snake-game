### SNAKE GAME 🐍 

This is a simple Snake Game developed in JavaScript. <br>
All design and illustrations, including pixel art, were also made by me.

##

### How to Play

👉 https://snakegame-ls.vercel.app/

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction.
2. Try to eat the apples to grow and earn points.
3. Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body.

##

### Features

I created a score tracking to monitor the score and display the score. As the score increases, <br> 
the speed increases proportionally and the snake moves faster. The apple is generated randomly, <br> 
taking care never to generate it in fields occupied by the snake's divs.
